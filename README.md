# GitHub User Activity CLI

This is a basic github user activity cli project from the roadmap.sh projects. The programming language used is JavaScript with the Node.js environment.

## Requirements

The application should run from the command line, accept a single input (name of the Github User) as the argument, and display the activities in a formatted output.

## Constraints

- Use positional arguments as the user input.
- Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid usernames or API failures.
- Do not use any external libraries or frameworks to fetch the GitHub activity.

## Example

```
# Running the program
npm start kamranahmedse 
# Output:
# - Pushed 3 commits to kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
# - Opened a new issue in kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
# - Starred kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
# - ... 
```
